        - Memory usage (ram what associated to the box)
        - CPU amount
    - Project folder name
    - Passwords for services inside vagrant & bootstrap sql, like mysql, phpmyadmin

##### 3.) Install the developer environment
    - cd vagrant

        - For packages check http://www.packagist.com please
    - Use composer autoload and composer.json file as well
    - Please use composer based autoload file (vendor/autoload.php) in your project


##### 5.) Database remote control
    - For database config, use this:
        - HOST: localhost
        - PORT: 3306 (standard, default)
        - USER: root
        - PASS: root (or what you give it in bootstrap.sh file)
    - For connection use SSH tunneling
        - IP/Proxy IP the vagrantbox ip, by default is 192.168.33.22
